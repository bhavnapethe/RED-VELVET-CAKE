RECIPE
How To Make Red Velvet Cake step by step. . . . . .


Step 1.    First preheat your oven to 350 F (176 C).  Next letâ€™s make our cake batter. Start by creating your butter and your white granulated or caster sugar together in a large bowl.  Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to do this.

Step 2.     Now we add in our eggs one at a time. So drop one egg in, mix, once that egg is completely incorporated do the other egg. Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as well as with a spatula.

Step 3.     Now we add in our cocoa powder. It is a good idea to run it through some kind of a sifter. Cocoa powder tends to get a bit lumpy. Then mix again and scrape the sides as needed. Throughout this whole process we donâ€™t want to over mix, just until things are incorporated. If we mix too much we will add too much air into the batter which we can cause air pockets in our cake.

Step 4.      Now add in your vanilla extract to your buttermilk as well as your white vinegar. If you donâ€™t have buttermilk you can make some by taking just shy of one cup of regular milk and adding one tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar and then let it sit out for about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and Vanilla extract until combined.
Step  5.     Now we add oil to the buttermilk mixture. Next add in about 2 to 2 and Â½ Tablespoons of red food coloring liquid. Then stir, until the mixture is a nice red color. Set that mixture aside for now.

Step 6.     Next we will add our salt and baking soda to our flour. You can use cake flour or all-purpose flour. Cake flour tends to work a little better, but all-purpose works great too. Use a whisk to combine those ingredients.

Step 7.     Next we will add in about half of our food coloring buttermilk mixture and about half or our flour mixture, then turn on the mixer and mix until just combined. Give the sides of the bowl a good scrape, then complete the process until all the ingredients have been mixed leaving you with a nice red velvet cake batter.

Step 8.      Now we just fill up two 9 inch or 8 inch cake pans with equal amounts of cake batter. Make sure to use shortening or kitchen spray on the pans and then dust with cocoa powder or flour and I always add a little round of parchment paper on the bottom too as an added precaution, and my nonstick are great, but I like to over-do itðŸ˜‚LOL. Also it is a good idea to lightly tap the pans with the batter in it, this will allow any cake bubbles to rise to the top, which helps to prevent air pockets, but sometimes it is unavoidable and you just get them, a combination of over mixing, etc. But it wonâ€™t effect the taste of the cake at all! So donâ€™t worry about it. I never do. Lol now bake those cakes for 23 to 30 minutes until when a toothpick comes out clean after poking it in the middle.

Step 9.   Now after the cakes come out of the oven letâ€™s leave it alone and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 mins. After that we can remove them from their pans, remove the parchment paper and then let the cakes cool completely on the rack. Afterwards you can place the cakes in the fridge and let them chill, which helps with the frosting, or just go onto the frosting step now, itâ€™s really up to you!

Step 10.  Well now it is time to make our frosting, we will be using just a few ingredients, cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract, and ofcourse powdered sugar (confectionerâ€™s sugar).

Step 11.   Now combine the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract into a large owl and mix with a hand mixer until nice and smooth usually takes a few minutes. Then slowly incorporate all of the powdered sugar. You may need more or less depending on the consistency that you want. Next just remove the batters.  Frosting is ready to go. At this point if the frosting is still too runny and more powdered sugar, or just chill it for about 30 minutes before frosting that cake.


Step 12.  First we will trip the cake so it will be somewhat level. You can skip this step if you like. I always use my bread knife to cut the top off the bottom layer, if you want to use fondant I recommend cutting the top of the top layer off as well, the end product will look a bit better. Next add a bunch of frosting to the middle, then layer the top layer of cake on. Then cover that whole cake with frosting. There are a variety of tools that you can use, I normally just use my cake spatula. Once done put the cake in the fridge for about 30 mins. This is optional, but I like to do it, allows the frosting to see a bit.

Step 13.  Now I want to make a heart-shaped cake topper. To do that I take my heart cookie cutter and cut out a shape from the middle of that piece of cake that I have. Then just place it on top of your cake.

Step 14.   Now take rest of your leftover cake and crumble it up with your fingers. Then gently apply it do your cake sides or on top or skip this step. It is totally up to you how you decorate your cake. :)
Use a piping bag and pipe frosting around the top of your heart if you like. You are done! Now place the cake in the fridge for about 2 hours before serving. Enjoy!
